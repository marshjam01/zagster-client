#This is a project for CS_160 at OSU-Cascades.

#The project is teaching how to incorporate data from a server into a GitHub page and display it into a visualization on a web page. 

#This data visualization incorporates chart.js

#The result is a graph of the number of rides per month from Zagsters bike rentals in Bend Oregon.
