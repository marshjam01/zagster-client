    <h1>Zagster Data Visual</h1>
    <P> By incorporating a plethora of programming and mark up language skills including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jquery, and SQL I was able to complete this project.
        I pulled data from a server and incorporated it into the data visualization that you see here.
The result is a graph that shows the entire number of rides per month beginning in September 2016 and ending in October 2018. 
Overall this project has given me glismp into the life a professional front-end developer.
